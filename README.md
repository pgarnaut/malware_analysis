NOTES
-----
* Currently I've only added my very crude scripts from a few years ago, which startup/shutdown a VM and yank results to the host box. 
* Haven't added the tools yet for actually extracting the information from the running (live) malware samples (some of them being proprietry).
* Havne't added the code that analyses the data offline yet either
* None of the above has been run in a long time :D


old instructions
----------------
1) VBox needs to be setup with a guest OS, and a snapshot taken. I called my vm "goat"
2) the guest bat file should be put in the startup folder in the program files dir, eg "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"
3) A directory structure like this was used....

D:\VBOX\
 - host.py
 - Results\               ---> host copies final results to here
 - Samples\               ---> host copies samples from here, into guest's waiting directory
 - vbox_share_infectable\
	- collections\    ---> guest puts zipped results in here
	- Samples\        ---> guest waits for sample.exe in here

final results of malware analysis goes into the VBOX\Results dir
samples that are to be run are put in the VBOX\Samples dir

host.py:
	restart's VM, and clears files from previous run
	copies a sample from VBOX\Samples to VBOX\vbox_share_infectable\sample.exe
	sleeps for a while
	grabs results.zip from VBOX\vbox_share_infectable\collections
		moves it to VBOX\Results\original_sample_name.zip
	loops
	
guest.bat
	waits for sample.exe to appear in vboxshare\Samples
	executes it
	does magical analysis
		- should put results in vboxshare\collections\results.zip
